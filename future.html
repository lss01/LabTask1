As a senior in college school, I ask myself this very question. After much thought, I have come up with a plan for my future. I realize that some of these plans and goals may change, but with a plan, the start of the journey can begin. After graduate from high school, I took Information Technology for diploma and I hope that i could able go higher to degree in government university which is University Technology Mara  when I finished diploma. My plan for the future is having a great job such as software developer or photographer with a loving family who's willing to support me in my good and bad times. But now I realize that there are so many other steps I need to take in order to achieve these so-called goals.<br><br> While attending college, it is my ultimate goal is advancing technology through a career as a software development. Most of all to be able to live up to the expectations I have for myself. I will only accomplish my goal of being happy by achieving all my dreams. I look forward to the challenges that I will face in my future and know that I will be able to “make it through anything” because of the challenges I have faced, my current dreams for the future, and the changes I hope to make for our world.Most important is study smart not study hard only.</font></td>
